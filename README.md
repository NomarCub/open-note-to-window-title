# Active note to window title

This might be the smallest Obsidian plugin, but it adds the current open note to the window title, like so:

`obsidian - Obsidian v0.11.0 - testing/currently-open-note-for-project-xyz.md`

This is useful when you are tracking your application usage with [Timing](https://timingapp.com/?lang=en) (or any other app that uses window title). Otherwise it might prove useful for context what you're doing when switching with alt-tab if your application switcher allows for filtering like [contexts.app](https://contexts.co/).
